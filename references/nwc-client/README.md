# NWC Client

## How to install

Install the NPM package `@getalby/sdk`. The latest version is 7.0.0.

## Connection Secret

To interact with a wallet you need a NWC connection string (Connection Secret) which gives permissioned access to the user's wallet. It must be handled like a secure API key, unless explicitly specified it's a public, receive-only connection secret.

## Units

All referenced files in this folder operate in millisats (1000 millisats = 1 satoshi).
