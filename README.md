# Alby Bitcoin Payments Agent Skill

Build lightning wallet functionality into your apps with your favorite agent, without hallucinations.

This repository contains an [agent skill](https://agentskills.io/specification) that helps agents use the [Alby JS SDK](https://github.com/getAlby/js-sdk) and [Alby Lightning Tools](https://github.com/getAlby/js-lightning-tools).

## Getting Started

### 1. Get your NWC Wallet

First, you need a NWC-capable wallet. To get started quickly and for free, try [CoinOS](https://coinos.io/) or [Rizful](https://rizful.com/). **For the best, self-sovereign NWC wallet experience, try [Alby Hub](https://getalby.com/alby-hub)**

### 2. Install the Alby Bitcoin Payments Agent Skill

[Download](https://github.com/getAlby/alby-agent-skill/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) this repository and extract it, then follow instructions for your specific agent.

> Double check the skill is activated by asking your agent "What Skills are available?". It should include "Alby Agent Skill"

## Example prompts

### Console Apps

#### Listen to received payments and send a payment to a lightning address with USD amounts

> Create a JS console app that when receives a notification of an incoming payment, sends $0.10 USD to <hello@getalby.com>. The NWC_URL is in the .env file.

#### Conditionally receive payments (NOTE: only supported by Alby Hub)

> Create a JS console app that creates a hold invoice of $1 and asks the user to provide a lightning address and choose heads or tails. Once the hold invoice is accepted, flip a coin. If the user guessed correctly, cancel the hold invoice and pay the user $1 to their lightning address. If the user guessed incorrectly, settle the hold invoice. The NWC_URL is in the .env file.

### Frontend Apps

#### Streamer QR page with payment notifications

> Create a single page HTML app that listens to incoming payments, and each time one comes in, shows a confetti animation and the payment amount and message. It should also have a QR code of the receiving lightning address that should be displayed on the corner of the screen so people watching can easily send payments. When I first open the page it should prompt me for a NWC connection secret so it can connect to my wallet to listen for payments, and also extract the lightning address from the NWC connection secret for the QR code.
